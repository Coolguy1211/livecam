# Welcome to the Live AI Camera Monitoring Suite Documentation

This website provides the official documentation for the Live AI Camera Monitoring Suite project.

## Overview

The Live AI Camera Monitoring Suite is a powerful, web-based application that allows you to monitor multiple IP camera streams in real-time. It uses the YOLOv3 object detection model to identify objects in the video feeds and can provide notifications for specific events.

## Features

*   **Web-Based Interface:** Access your camera feeds from anywhere with a web browser.
*   **Multi-Camera Support:** Monitor multiple cameras simultaneously.
*   **Real-Time AI Detection:** Uses the YOLOv3 model to detect 80 different types of objects.
*   **Notification System:** Get notified when specific objects (like a person) are detected.
